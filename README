This is the readme for TrackSys, the seng 330 final project for our team.
The src folder contains the java code being served by Jetty (http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/).  
	ServletHandler is a the javax servlet which will redirect requests to their appropriate views.
	

The public folder is the html/css/js files that will be served with apache, which then make calls to the java servlet.  

To get this project running you need java 5+, and eclipse.  Just simply import the project and run it.  Access the web app at http://localhost:1234
